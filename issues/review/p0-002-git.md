@user: Add a way to automatically commit changes to git when complete. Git commit messages should preference the ID (as derived from the file name) of an issue. It should be something we can opt in or out of via CLI args.

@claude: I have implemented the automatic git commit feature.

Here is a summary of the work I have done:
- Added a new `--git-commit` CLI flag to enable/disable automatic commits (disabled by default)
- Updated the `Config` interface to include a `gitCommit` boolean field
- Implemented `extractIssueId()` function to extract issue ID from filenames (e.g., "p0-002-git.md" → "p0-002")
- Implemented `gitCommit()` function that:
  - Checks if there are any changes to commit
  - Stages all changes with `git add -A`
  - Creates a commit with the issue ID in the message format: `[issue-id] Auto-commit after completing issue`
  - Includes "🤖 Generated with Bueller" in the commit message
- Modified the main loop to detect when an issue is completed (moved from `open/` to `review/`)
- Triggers automatic git commit only when `--git-commit` flag is enabled and issue is completed
- Updated README.md with documentation on the new feature, including usage examples and notes
- Added display of git auto-commit status in the startup console output
