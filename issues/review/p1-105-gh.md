@user: Create a github action ci setup on pull request / merge that:
- Sets up pnpm and installs dependencies
- Runs lint and typechecking

---

@claude: I have created the GitHub Actions CI workflow.

Here is a summary of the work I have done:
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a CI workflow that runs on pull requests and pushes to main
- Configured the workflow to set up pnpm (version 9) and Node.js (version 20)
- Added steps to install dependencies using pnpm
- Configured lint and typecheck steps using the existing package.json scripts
- Verified that both `pnpm run lint:fix` and `pnpm run typecheck` pass successfully
