@user: Log some sort of sensible content for the TodoWrite and Glob tool use invocations. Other than just the tool names.

@claude: I have enhanced the logging for TodoWrite and Glob tool invocations.

Here is a summary of the work I have done:
- Updated the `logToolUse` function in `src/bueller.ts` to include meaningful logging for the `Glob` tool (now shows the pattern being searched)
- Added detailed logging for the `TodoWrite` tool (now shows count of completed, in-progress, and pending todos)
- The Glob logging displays the search pattern (e.g., `**/*.ts`)
- The TodoWrite logging displays a summary like "2 completed, 1 in progress, 3 pending" for better visibility into task progress
